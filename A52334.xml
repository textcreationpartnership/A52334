            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very thing according to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is valuable, and the more glorious the more eſtimable. It is not the greatneſſe of any thing that ought to purchaſe it eſteem; nor muſt the ſmalneſſe or littleneſſe of a vertuous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſubſtance decreaſe its worth: But great things as joyned with the glorie of their perfection, are ſo and no otherwiſe of great and high eſteem: and little things are no otherwiſe valuable, then according to the glorious beauty of their perfection. Here, Right Worſhipfull, I preſent you with things great and ſmall, but with none without their vertues. They are created ſubſtances of the moſt enduring nature, which this our part of the ſubce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall world doth contain: The glory
<pb facs="tcp:99609:3"/>
of thoſe which ſhall here find beautified with externall grace, will feed your eyes with much pleaſure in beholding: and their internall vertues, and the ſymboles whereby by them are diſcovered to us the glorious excellency of ſuper-celeſtiall things, will in the right conſideration of them no leſſe feed your ſpirit with delight, then doth their externall beautie and perfection pleaſe your eye, when it doth behold their glory. Every one out of their common apprehenſions of worth, and out of that mean perception which they have of things dignified above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with beauty and with glory, eſteem them valuable: Gemms and Jewells are thus dignified with externall glory, and enricht with internall ſymbolical vertues. For this cauſe with thoſe that have but mean and common apprehenſions of their worth, they are eſteemed. And for their ſymbolical reſemblances of ſuper-celeſtiall things, amongſt the wiſeſt of ancient times they have had upon them an high eſtimate of value and of worth. Surely, we live not in the moſt unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:99609:3"/>
times of the world; nay, never was this part of the world fuller of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then now it is, wherein many are bleſt with excellent gifts and endowments by which they are enabled to enquire more throughly into the nature and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of things, then ever. Amongſt theſe who know the true nature of things, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor gemms, nor jewells, nor any other vertuous thing ſhall want their due e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. Nor with you, Right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I am ſure, can that which is truly vertuous want its value.</p>
            <p>It is a Philoſophick axiome, <hi>Ineſt ſua gratia parvis;</hi> I have here taken the pains to open the ſmall cabinets of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, that I may diſcover the true vertues which are contained in many ſmal things and little creatures. This I have done, firſt, by a ſearch and diligent enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cauſes and natures of Gemms, and into ſuch qualities as may poſsibly from thence in them ariſe: Then by partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <hi>Anſelmus Boetius</hi> with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> tongue: In the doing of which, I have endeavoured, according to what I
<pb facs="tcp:99609:4"/>
find in Scripture, and according to what I find in other Authours, to take away that confuſion about the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of gemms, which doth cauſe them to be hardly and difficultly known of what <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kinds they are. And withall, I have not onely laboured with <hi>Boetius,</hi> but alſo with divers other Lapidiſts, to ſhew the true way of diſcerning factitious and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall ſtones or gemms, from thoſe that are really and truly the works of nature, that ſo the fallacies and ſophiſtications of Artiſts, being clearly and perſpicuouſly manifeſted and diſcovered, nature may not be belied in the glory of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall workings and actions.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of that pains which I have here taken, which together with my whole endeavours in this kind, Right Worſhipfull, with generall good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I dedicate to you, that under your protection it may in the light detect falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and diſcover truth to many.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99609:12"/>
though it be full of atomes, and the fire doth much excell them both in diaphanitie; hence he ſaith <hi>copia aquae non eſt diaphanitatis cauſa, ſed aliud quiddam,</hi> to wit, the exact union of the earth, reſolved <hi>in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas particulas,</hi> and ſo plainly and exquiſitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, that the body conſtituted of it, can by no means be diſcerned to have any pores or atomes in it.

               <p>In perfectly tranſparent or perſpicuous gemms or ſtones, colours have their originall from the refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reflection of the light, which diverſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in Cryſtalls, is cauſed by the multiplicitie of their ſuperficies.

               <p>Thus have we ſeen the various judgements of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Authours, concerning the originall of divers colours, in gemms or pretious ſtones, and in plants and other creatures: ſome imputing the originall of the varietie of beauty in colour to the <hi>balſamum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> or to the <hi>Sal armoniacum</hi> contained in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall matter of all things: others making mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exhalations the cauſe of colours in them: others the elaboration of the firſt qualities upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their ſubſtance. Some imputing it to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious commixtion of two extremities, to wit of black and white, of darkneſſe and light; But how can this be, ſeeing darkneſſe is no colour, but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of colour; and a very forgetfulneſſe of all thoſe colours which by light we may diſcover; for in its preſence we are deprived of the remarkable views of thoſe viſible qualities of various colours, by which we do on earth diſtinguiſh things. Then as for light we ſee that it is guilty of no tincture in it ſelf, and by how much it hath more or leſſe of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99609:15"/>
accidentall, ſo much it doth fall ſhort of the perfection of its light. Light and darkneſſe are at continuall ſtrife, the preſence of the one cauſeth the abſence of the other. No ſooner did that bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light move upon the face of the waters of the great deep, but ſtraight darkneſſe affrighted with the all-awfull preſence of its glory fled away. No ſooner doth the ſunne ariſe to runne its courſe, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſetting forth from under its pavilion, but ſtraight the amazed ſhades of darkeſt nights flee all away. No ſooner doth the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe begin to dart his beams of glory into the horrid darkneſſe of mans ſinfull heart, but ſtraight this powerfull word, moving on the ſurface of this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, begets a new creation, and ſets up there a glory, by which through the qualities of earthly colours we may diſcover the excellency of heavenly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. But the darkneſſe of the heart all amazed at this ſudden powerfull motion in this centre, ſtraight forſakes its ſtation, and fearfully fleeing leaves its habitation to the light. If then there be ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt light and darkneſſe, that nothing may interpoſe for agreement, how ſhall we think they ſhould ever joyn by mixture in ſubſtantiall matters to produce varietie of colours. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no agreement betwixt theſe two extremes, to make for the effecting of ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing qualities as are colours; then if from them they do proceed, they muſt be the ſad effects of their contrary operations: ſad I ſay, becauſe light being oppreſſed by darkneſſe wains; and which is our grief, darkneſſe can nothing be impayred, there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99609:15"/>
being nothing worſe then it. As it is darkneſſe it cannot be impayred, but as it is darkneſſe extended, it may be, and is, and ſhall be coarctated.</p>

               <p>ANy throughly tranſparent tinctured gemm what ever, may be adulterated by two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires, or with two Cryſtalls, having a foyl betwixt them. But ſuch duplicated gemms, which are tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured either with a foyl of Maſtick, or with other coloured foyls in their intermediate ſpace, are thus ordinarily and uſually diſcerned by Jewellers: They will take the gemm and put it upon their thumb nail, and then direct their ſight betwixt the plain of the gemm and of their nail; and if the upper part of the gemm be white, and no colour be added (which lying hid under the ſides of the <hi>ciſtae</hi> can there be perceived) then the upper part of the gemm will plainly appear white as it is, and ſo it will diſcover it ſelf to be an adulterated gemm in ſtead of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall one. This is a very eaſie way to diſcover facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99609:16"/>
gemms from naturall ones. But thoſe factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gemms which conſiſt of many angles fitted for this purpoſe, by various ſections, hollowings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavations, cannot ſo eaſily be perceived, becauſe the reflections from the angles, do give tincture from the foyl in every part of the ſuperficies of the gemm. Another kind of ingenious fraud there is, by which gemms are adulterated, and that is when as cunning Artiſts do excavate a gemm, as a white Saphire, or a Cryſtall, in the lower part of it with a very ſmall <hi>foramen,</hi> and then infuſe into it a drop of ſome trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent liquour, which being artificially done, will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellently diffuſe its colour through the bodie of the whole gemm: Thus the idea's of true Rubies, Saphires, Smaragdes are produc'd. There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of way of ſubtill fraud in gemms, when as cunning ſophiſticatours do macerate gemms in coloured or tinctured waters, or ſo tincture them in fire, or by any other means, that the tincture or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour may enter the body of the gemm. Theſe frauds can no otherwiſe be diſcovered, but by taking the gemms out of their <hi>ciſtis,</hi> encloſures, or ſettings, and ſo taking a naked view of them with full ſight. As for other gemms which are diſſembled with tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red glaſſe, theſe for the moſt part ſeem to have a <hi>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licula</hi> or little film in their ſuperficies, as if they were anointed with oyl, which is never to be found in true gemms. There are factitious gemms made of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, and of flints, and lead, which will be harder then the common glaſſe, and tranſparent as Cryſtal; in the making of which, to tincture them, cunning artiſts are wont to adde metalls to it, or tinctures, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99609:17"/>
colours of metalls, and thus they being committed to the fire, by the operation of the heat upon them, will be produced a gemme ſcarcely to be diſcerned from the true gemm, ſave onely by the atomes in the middle of their bodie, and by thoſe ſmall <hi>bullae</hi> which are often cauſed in them by the unequall working of the fire upon their matter, or by the extreme vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of its heat.<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the file in the triall of gemms.</note> Of theſe kinds of factitious gemms there are ſome ſo perfect, and free from the ſmall <hi>bullae</hi> and atomes, as that they can no wayes be diſcerned from the true gemms but by the uſe of the file; for theſe may be filed, the true ones cannot, except onely the Topaz and Smaragde: and by their gravitie, weight, and ponderoſity; for theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious ſtones are much heavier then the true, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of lead and metalls, which are very ponderous and weighty: and by their pining, dead, fading look, which if they be long beheld, do afford no pleaſure to the eye by feeding it; whereas in true gemms there is alwayes a lively ſplendour, which by reaſon of the reflection of the ſeverall tables or ſides of the ſuperficies, gives it ſelf forth with the more ſparkling delight. Another way of adulteration of gemms there is, very ſubtill, and more excellent then any of the former, which is this, Cunning Chymiſts will make a lapidifick water of mineralls, and then poure of it into waxen forms, which forms they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge for ſome time in an indurative water, and thus produce a gemm not unlike to the true. <hi>Vide Anſelm.

               <p>Such effects as are to be found in the world are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Effects which are in their perfection above all the power of naturall cauſes: For example ſake, 1. No naturall cauſe can ſeparate the heat from the fire; nor can any naturall cauſe make fire to burn without heat. 2. It is above the power of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe to make a man inviſible: no naturall cauſe can effect this, becauſe man is an opake or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure body, and ſuch a body as hath no perſpicuity or tranſparency at all in it: and therefore it cannot poſſibly be, that it ſhould be made inconſpicuous or diſapparent without ſome preſent impediment. <hi>Boet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Effects which do not exceed the power of naturall cauſes, but yet are above the mean which naturall cauſes do uſe, to produce ſuch effects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſcript rule, and order of nature. Such an effect is this which followeth: The Saviour of the world was born of the Virgin Mary, as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for a man to be born of a woman: but here, the mean and manner of begetting, and of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſupernaturall, and above all the power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

cauſes: for here the conception and manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting was altogether without the coition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of man, which effect could be no otherwiſe cauſed then by a ſupernaturall power; namely by the power of God, who did wonderfully effect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth of Chriſt in the wombe of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by the power of his Holy Spirit. Theſe two firſt kinds of effects which have been and may be found in the world, Boetius (<hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 45.) ſaith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be brought to paſſe, but by the power of God, or of the devil, God permitting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Effects which do not exceed the power of naturall cauſes, but yet the cauſes applyed for the producing of theſe effects do not keep the ordinary mean for the producing of them. Such an effect is this of Chymiſtry, when as by chymicall art gold is made of ſilver: And ſuch an effect is this which is ſo oft practiſed in natures orchards and gardens; where when as nature by her own work doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſeverall ſpecies of fruits from their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar originalls; art doth as it were force and violate her to contradict her law, rule, and order, by inſitions and inoculations: and by this means we may oft times ſee the fruitfulleſt and beſt trees, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits of other ſtocks then their own.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Effects which do depend upon naturall cauſes, which obſerve and keep the ordinary mean which are to be applyed for the producing of ſuch and ſuch effects. Such an effect as this it is, when as the rain is generated by the aſcending up of vapours; and when ice is diſſolved into water by the power of the heat of the Sunne; and when man is generated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99609:27"/>
of man and woman, which is natures ordinary way for generation.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the effects which are found in the world, the fourth and laſt kind of which are purely naturall; which that they may be really ſo, they do require divers conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Conditions to make effects truly naturall.</head>
               <p n="1">1. That an effect may be truly naturall, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that there ſhould be ſome ſubject preſent, which may receive the effect from its efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is required, that there ſhould be a certain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or diſtance betwixt the efficient cauſe, and the ſubject out of which the effect is to be produced, beyond which diſtance or limit, the effect cannot at all be produced; this will appear by this ſolary example. The ſunne whileſt it hath its reſidence <hi>in Tropico Auſtrali,</hi> or in the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> cannot ſo warm the regions and countreys that are ſituate about the Artick pole, as it doth warm them when it hath its reſidence in the Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That an effect may be naturall, it is required, that the efficient cauſe or immediate agent be not hindred in its action upon its ſubject, and penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its ſubject, by ſome other interpoſing or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediating body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is required, that there ſhould be a full ſpace betwixt the cauſe and the effect, that is, <hi>ſpatium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum &amp; conjunctum;</hi> that ſo naturall things may <hi>in ſe mutuò agere,</hi> and thus obtain their perfection.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That an effect may be naturall it is required,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99609:28"/>
that the medium or mean which is betwixt the cauſe and the ſubject, be aptly and fitly diſpoſed to receive the vertue of the agent or efficient, for elſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, notwithſtanding the concurrency of all other things together, that any naturall effects ſhould univerſally follow.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Again, the Fair ones are tranſparent either 1. with Colour. or, 2. without Colour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Fair ones tranſparent with Colour are the <hi>Jacinth, Beryll, Ruby, Praſsius, Rubicell, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praſſus, Spinell, Granat, Amandine, Chryſolite, Ballaſſe, Carbuncle, Saphire, Emerauld, Gemma Solis, Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſmall common ſtones are either 1. Hard. or, 2. Soft.</p>
               <p>Hard firſt, as the <hi>Briſtol diamonds,</hi> or the <hi>Pſeudo-diamond</hi> of Hungary.</p>

the <hi>Smaragde-praſsius,</hi> which do all partake of tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or colour; and the <hi>Cryſtall,</hi> and the <hi>Bohemian Diamond,</hi> which are diaphanous without colour.</p>
               <p>Again, the rare hard ſtones are, 1.

               </p>
               <p>Again, there are common great ſtones which are 1. either hard, fair, and beautifull; or, 2. hard, and evil coloured.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the hard, fair, and beautifull ſtones of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude are the <hi>Marble.</hi> Secondly, common, hard, evil coloured ſtones, are the <hi>Whetſtone, Pyrite,</hi> the common ſtone, the <hi>Flint.</hi>

                     <p>The Ancients have had a very high eſteem of this ſtone,<note place="margin">Andreas Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, c. <hi>15.</hi> de Nat. gemmar.</note> inſomuch as they have thought it to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with divine vertues; and ſuch, as that if it were but worn included in a ring, or carried about a body neare his heart; it could aſſwage the fury of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and expell vain fears from his heart, preſerve from ſwooning, drive away the vanity of dreams, and the terrours of the night, and fruſtrate all the maligne contagious power of poyſons. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it that it is endued with ſuch a faculty, as that if it be in place with a <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> it bindeth up all its power, and hindereth all its attractive vertue.</p>
                     <p>If a true <hi>Diamond</hi> be put upon the head of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without her knowledge, it will make her in her ſleep, if ſhe be faithfull to her husband, to caſt her ſelf into his embraces; but if ſhe be an adultereſſe, to turn away from him.

It is of eſteem for its own irreſiſtible hardneſſe, and for the puritie of its perfect glory, in which it doth excell all other gemms of price, and ſtones of worth.</p>
                     <p>A well poliſht <hi>Diamond</hi> without fault, of the weight of a pepper-corn, is worth ten Florens or Crowns, Boetius <hi>pag.</hi> 63.

                     <p>There is a proverbiall uſe of it, which is taken from its hardneſſe, and applyed either to animate or inanimate things:<note place="margin">Statius lib. <hi>1.</hi> Heſiod. l. <hi>1.</hi> Horat. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi> carm.</note> of this uſe we may read in Statius, Heſiode, and Horace.

                     <p>The forms into which moſt commonly it is cut, is a Tablet, which conſiſteth of one plain upper Table, and foure latterall Tables, two of which are wont to be longer then the other two, that they may make the juſt proportion of the upper Table; and ſuch a Tablet as this, Boetius ſaith, is of form moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: a <hi>Diamond</hi> thus cut weighing one <hi>Ceratium</hi>

                  <p>The true <hi>Carbuncle</hi> or <hi>Ruby</hi> is a tranſparent jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell of the colour of pure vermilion or crimſon; by how much the more fiery it doth appear in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, ſo much the better it is; if it have any yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe in it, it is of the kinds of <hi>Granates,</hi> or <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths:</hi> from its excellent flame it is diſtinguiſhed from other gemms which have like repreſentations and reſemblances; a <hi>Carbuncle</hi> is nothing elſe but a great <hi>Rubine,</hi> and a great <hi>Rubine</hi> is thought worthy of the name of a <hi>Carbuncle;</hi> if a <hi>Rubine</hi> be found ſo bigge as that it may weigh twenty <hi>Ceratia,</hi> that is a drachme and a ſcruple, then may it worthily be called by the name of a <hi>Carbuncle.</hi> Ludovicus Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomannus a Romane, reporteth that the king of Pege a city in India, had a <hi>Carbuncle</hi> of ſo great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude and ſplendour, that by the clear light of it, he might in a dark place be ſeen, even as if the room or place had been illuſtrated by the ſunne beams.</p>

                     <head>Of its tincture or foyl.</head>
                     <p>THis though it be a very glorious ſtone and of excellent beauty, yet a foyl is uſed to it, as to all other gemms of tranſparency &amp; perſpicuity. The foyl is either made of tinctured Maſtick, or of a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99609:34"/>
dyed vitreous ſubſtance, or elſe a red gold foyl is uſed about it.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of its Adulteration.</head>
                     <p>IT may be adulterated by a <hi>Rubine</hi> of a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute redneſſe, by putting a red gold foyl tincture, or colour under it, or by putting ſome ſplendent glaſſe dyed with a red colour under it; And thus without diligent caution it may be taken for a true jewell, and the rather becauſe all are helpt with a foyl. Another way of its adulteration is by a white <hi>Saphire,</hi> or a <hi>Cryſtall,</hi> or a <hi>Topaz,</hi> or an ordinary <hi>Diamond,</hi> with a red gold foyl placed under it, in its encloſing, either in ouch or ring. Another way they have of adulterating of it, and that is, by glew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two fair <hi>Cryſtals</hi> together with a little maſtick tinctured with a red or crimſon colour: In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have ſeen two pieces of <hi>Cryſtall</hi> ſo glewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as that they being once ſet with a foyl, they could hardly be diſcerned from a true <hi>Ruby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The adulteration of this gemm may be thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, Firſt by the want of ſparkling and ſending forth of lively rayes. Then by bringing the gemm to the triall of the file. A true <hi>Rubie</hi> will endure the file; but a factitious ſtone, or a ſoft counterfeited adulterated ſtone will not. Another way of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſhood will be this: take the jewell you ſuſpect, and direct your eye from the verge or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of its incloſure, through the gemm unto the oppoſite ſide of its encloſure; and if it conſiſt of two parts with a tinctured foyl betwixt, you will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99609:35"/>
eaſily perceive the upper part to be void of colour, from whence you may gather that it doth receive its glory from the foyl. Such Artificiall angles and corners will jewellers cut and excavate in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of ſoft tranſparent ſtones (as I have ſeen) that by the manifold reflection of theſe lower <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,</hi> into every part of the uppermoſt <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the jewell, a skilfull jeweller ſhall hardly perceive their craft.</p>
                     <p>There is an adulteration of the <hi>Ruby</hi> with boiled orpement, but theſe are fit for nothing elſe but ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of this mention is made in <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi> in his <hi>Magia. lib. de gem.</hi>

                  <p>As concerning their originall and conception, there is ſome difference amongſt Authours, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Pliny and Anſelmus Boetius, and betwixt them and Cardanus.</p>
                  <p>Pliny ſaith that they are conceived in oyſters of a certain maritime dew which theſe fiſh (and ſo likewiſe Scallops) do at time of the yeare much thirſt after; and according as the heavens are more cloudy or clear in the time of their taking in of this dew, ſo they are generated, more fair, or more obſcure, as may be read in his book, where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the nature of thoſe Pearls which are called <hi>Unions,</hi> and of the ſhell-fiſh in which they are found; as <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 28. But this opinion of Pliny concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conception, is by Anſelmus Boetius thought not to be conſentaneous to the truth; for ſaith he, I have taken out of theſe ſhell-fiſh many <hi>Margarites,</hi> and they are generated in the body of the creature, of the ſame humour of which the ſhell is formed; which viſcuous humour is expelled ſometimes, not alwayes, for the fabrick of another ſhell: for when ever this little creature is ſick or ill, and hath not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99609:45"/>
ſtrength enough to belch up, or to expell this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which ſticketh in its body, it becometh the rudiments or beginnings of <hi>Margarites;</hi> to which, new humour being often added and aſſimulated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of <hi>Margarites,</hi> of this new addition of humour, by concretion and congelation, is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a new film or skinne to the firſt rudiments of <hi>Margarites,</hi> of which at length by further additions of humour, is generated an <hi>Union</hi> or <hi>Pearl:</hi> even as ſtones are generated in the gall, or bladder of a man, and after the ſame manner that the Bezar ſtone is generated in the Indian Goat.</p>
                  <p>Cardanus <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de lapidibus</hi> ſaith, it is a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing that <hi>Pearls</hi> ſhould be generated of the dew of heaven, ſeeing that the ſhell-fiſhes in which they are conceived, have their reſidence in the very bottome of the depths of the ſea.

Theſe are brought to <hi>Bengala</hi> for bracelets and other uſes.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99609:48"/>
ſome writers. The firſt of which is the beſt. Of all others of the kinds this doth onely truly deſerve the name of a <hi>Saphire</hi> to diſtinguiſh this from all other <hi>Saphires</hi> it is called <hi>Sapphirus caeruleus:</hi> Dionyſius Afer calleth it for this purpoſe <hi>Cyaneus Sapphirus,</hi> as ſaith Wurtzung, in 2, <hi>tab.</hi> of his generall practiſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. The beſt <hi>Saphire</hi> Andreas Baccius (<hi>lib. de nat. gem. c.</hi> 7.) doth thus deſcribe; If it have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tenour in it ſelf, that is, if it be neither too obtuſe or dull, by reaſon of the groſſneſſe of that <hi>Succus,</hi> juyce, or nouriſhment of which it was generated; nor too much dejected with a propenſe perſpicuitie; but doth pleaſantly diſcover from it ſelf, by reaſon of the mixture of light and purple, the delightfull flower of a sky-colour. This is the excellent <hi>Saphire,</hi> which in the order of noble gemms Cardanus doth rank in the fifth place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond kind declineth from the blue to a green, and is in Greek called <hi>Praſitis,</hi> and <hi>Sapphirus Praſsitis,</hi> and <hi>Sapphirus viridis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wurtz. tab. <hi>2.</hi> gener. pract.</note> by this name it is known to the Druggiſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third kind declineth from the blue to the yellow, and is called in Greek <hi>Chryſitis,</hi> and <hi>Sapphirus Chryſitis.</hi> The Simpliciſts do call it <hi>Sapphirus Aureus:</hi> In Engliſh this is called <hi>the yellow Saphire.</hi> This is a gemme that doth ſhine with golden ſpecks and ſpots, as ſaith Dioſcorides, and Plinie <hi>lib.</hi> 37. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth kind is between blue and white, it is in colour like skimmed milk, very perſpicuous and clear; and this is that gemm which is called <hi>Sapphirus candidus,</hi> or the <hi>white Saphire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are many times ſubſtituted for <hi>Diamonds:</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99609:49"/>
and they are called the female <hi>Saphires,</hi> the other the male. That ſtone which Pliny doth in ſome place call the <hi>Saphire,</hi> is the <hi>Cyanus</hi> or <hi>Lapis Lazuli.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Saphire</hi> is of a cold and drie faculty, even as are moſt pretious ſtones: it is reported of it, that it is good againſt feveriſh diſtempers, hence this old diſtick.
<q>

The beſt of theſe are very comfortable to the eyes, if they be often looked one. It is reported of it, that if it be worn by an adulterer, by looſing its ſplendour it will diſcover his adultery: and that the wearing of it, doth hinder the erections that are cauſed by Venus. But ſurely, as either luſtfull
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99609:49"/>
thoughts, or this wicked ſpirit <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> moving them, or ſtirring up ſuch diſorders and irregularities without them, in the body, are the cauſes of ſuch undue erections of the fleſh: ſo when he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, this ſtone hath power to hinder them, and not before. Many have written of the faculties of this ſtone; as Galen, Dioſcorides, Cardanus, Garcias, and Macer the Poet, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of it, that it is of ſo contrary a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to poyſons, that if it be put into a glaſſe with a Spider, or laid upon the mouth of the glaſſe where the Spider is, the Spider will quickly die. And that it keepeth men chaſte, and therefore is worn of Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmus Boetius ſaith, that S. Jerome affirmeth in his expoſition of the 19. chap. of Iſaiah, that the <hi>Saphire</hi> being worn of any man, procureth him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Princes, and with all men; pacifieth his enemies, freeth him from inchantments, and from bonds, and impriſonments, and that it looſeth men out of priſon, and aſſwageth the wrath of God.

                     <p>For its ſacred uſe it hath been eſteemed of great worth, as Exod. 28.18. And for its ſuperſtitions, take this caution, uſe it with much circumſpection.

                     <p>It is deſired of many for its excellent beauty; for it is fair like unto a ſerene skie: No better a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of its excellent beauty can you find, then that which is given of it, Exodus 24.9, 10. Where it is ſpoken after the manner of men (not as if the children of Iſrael ſaw any appearance of God in the form of man) That the children of Iſrael ſaw the God of Iſrael: and there was under his feet, as it were a paved work of <hi>Saphire</hi> ſtone, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearneſſe.</p>
                     <p>This ſtone is valued according to the excellency of its colour, beauty, purity, and greatneſſe: one of the weight of four grains is worth many crowns. The beſt of theſe are as much worth as a <hi>Diamond</hi> of the ſame bigneſſe.</p>

For this cauſe it is thought to be a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy for the mitigating of choler and of cholerick paſſions.

                     <p>Authours do ſay of it, that if it be put upon a table where poyſon is or venome is left, it will ſtraight-way fail of its ſplendour, and looſe its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo ſoon as the poyſon or venome is taken away, it will recover all its glory again; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is this alſo which is reported of this ſtone, namely, that it doth increaſe and decreaſe in its ſtrength of powers and faculties, according to the increaſe and decreaſe of the Moon.</p>
                     <p>This ſtone is ſo hard that it will endure the file, and it groweth into ſo great a maſſe, that oft times ſtatues have been made of it.

It was one of thoſe gemms which had a place in one of thoſe four rowes of ſtones engraven with the names of the tribes of Iſrael, and ſet in ouches of gold upon the breaſt-plate of Judgement, as Exodus 28.17. where it was ſaid of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the order of the pretious ſtones in the breaſt-plate of Judgement, The firſt row ſhall be a <hi>Sardius</hi> and a <hi>Topaz,</hi> and a <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> this ſhall be the firſt row.

                     <p>It is of the nature of the <hi>Solaris,</hi> or <hi>Sun-ſtone.</hi> Cardanus in his book of admirable cures, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wonders concerning the vertues of the <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite;</hi> he ſaith that with the alone powder of it drunk in wine, he cured Ceſar Palavicinus of a fever that he had been troubled withall fifteen dayes, and another Noble-man of Melancholy, and of the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the ſame remedy, after that he had long in vain been tormented with the ſomniferous lotions of Phyſicians.

                     <p>It is of eſteem, not onely for its ſun-ſhine glory; but for that alſo it hath been of ſacred uſe. This is one of thoſe ſtones by which the glory of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth foundation of the wall of the New-Jeruſalem is diſcovered to us, as Revel. 21.20.</p>
                     <p>It is for its gratefull aſpect of very great eſteem. It is ſo perfectly hard, as that by the heat of fire it may be made diaphanous and void of all colour, and thus like the beſt <hi>Saphire,</hi> changed into an admirable <hi>Diamond;</hi> in ſo much as it being thus dealt withall, no other ſtone whatever can better reſemble an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall <hi>Diamond</hi> then it will.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Chryſolite</hi> of the weight of eight grains is

Well may it deſerve the name of a pretious Jewell for its own glorious diaphanity and untinctured perſpicuity; and not onely in regard of its own proper and peculiar beauty, but alſo for that by it, in Holy writ we have the glory of many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things diſcovered to us by Emblemes.

There is great difference betwixt the ice and <hi>Cryſtall;</hi> the ice will ſwimme in the water, but the <hi>Cryſtall</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more weighty, doth ſtraight reſide: Diodorus Siculus doth very clearly diſſolve this difference in the latter end of his third book; where he ſaith, that <hi>Cryſtall</hi> is a ſtone which hath its originall of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99609:66"/>
pure water congealed, not by the power of cold. (Though in Eccleſiaſtes it be ſaid, <hi>flavit ventus aquilo, &amp; congelavit cryſtallum</hi>) But by a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, of an enlivening quickening heat which cauſeth it to keep its <hi>durities,</hi> and often times to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo many various delightfull colours to the eye.</p>
                  <p>Anſelmus Boetius ſaith, that <hi>Cryſtall</hi> is the pureſt part of the earth diſſolved by water, which in the abſence of the water is congealed into <hi>Cryſtall;</hi> it is not, he ſaith, as is ſuppoſed, congealed water, for then like unto ice it would be diſſolved with heat, and conſumed by fire: but it is ſo farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming in the fire as that it being long molten or burned therein, it doth become a <hi>Calx,</hi> and pure earth, or a ſalt, by the benefit of whoſe ſpirit it is coagulated.</p>

                  <p>Half-tranſparent gemms admit of no foyls or tinctures; the reaſon of it is cleare in the ſight of every eye: for what-ever foyl may be ſubſtrate in an encloſure of gold, under an half-tranſparent gemme, cannot for want of greater tranſparencie, render it more glorious then naturally it is in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And as it admitteth of no foyl, ſo there is no adulteration of it to be found in Anſelmus Boetius: what may be done by artificiall ſophiſtications in this kind, I ſhall let alone, till further opportunitie, greater helps, and better informations. Onely this Boetius ſaith, that it is adulterated with glaſſe of the ſame colour: but this is very unlike, as every know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye will eaſily diſcover.</p>

                     </note>Andr.

Claudius Richardus in his deſcription of this ſtone <hi>ad Archiepiſc. Strigonien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem,</hi> ſaith, The <hi>Bezoar</hi> is a round long ſtone, in form like an acorn without its cup, outwardly like poliſht iron, but inwardly of an aſhy colour. It is not very ponderous, becauſe full of pores, and therefore it is eaſily broken. It hath no arenoſitie or harſh ſandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all with it; if it be taken betwixt the teeth, it doth diſſolve like a cruſt of bread, ſoftened with the ſalivous humour of the mouth: it hath in it no ſavour as ſome ſay, but Richardus ſaith, it hath with it a gratefull ſavour.

                     <p>This ſtone being a ſtone of value, it is to be feared, ſaith Andreas Baccius, leaſt merchants for lucre ſake ſhould adulterate it; which adulterations he ſaith may thus be diſcovered: the naturall <hi>Bezoars</hi> are rude, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, unpoliſhed, as thoſe ſtones that are found in the bladder of a man: theſe he ſaith will leave no tincture upon the palm of the hand, if they be there rubbed with a little moiſture from the mouth; but the artificiall ones will leave a tincture if they be ſo rubbed. The adulterate ones or artificiall ones are alſo made in form like a kidney or a pigeons egg, and theſe are externally ſmooth and poliſhed, and they being broken, their pieces are hard <hi>inſtar terrae coctae</hi> or <hi>gypſi,</hi> that is, like clay or earth dryed and hardened by the power of the heat of the fire.</p>
                     <p>Boetius ſaith that the artificiall or factitious <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar</hi> doth uſually contain in its cavity either chaff or herbs; and ſometimes like ſmall ſeeds.</p>
                     <p>A ſure way to try a factitious one is this, give ſome few grains of it to a dog or ſuch like creature that hath taken poyſon, and if it be a true <hi>Bezoar,</hi> it will quickly diſcover its vertue in prevailing againſt the poyſon; if otherwiſe, its want of vertue, power
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99609:97"/>
and prevalency will very eaſily diſcover it to be not of nature, but of art.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of the eyes of the <hi>Hyaena</hi> that they are of a ſtony ſubſtance; Pliny taketh the <hi>Bezoar-ſtones</hi> ſaith Martinus Rulandus for theſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calleth them <hi>gemmae Hyaeniae.</hi> Martinus Rulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus taketh the <hi>Bezoar</hi> for the congealed tears of a Deare: The Eaſtern Deare he ſaith in the Spring time are wont to ſearch the Caverns for ſerpents, which when they find, they are wont to ſnuff them up into their noſtrils and thus purge themſelves of their annuall diſtempers; which ſo ſoon as they have ſnuffed up or eaten, ſtrait-way they flie to the rivers or waters, and in them overwhelm themſelves to the very head, ſo long, as till they perceive the power and force of the venome of the ſerpents which they have taken to be overcome: In this mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the power and force of the venome, their eyes ſhed forth abundance of tears which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated and congealed about them; theſe coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated dryed tears Martinus Rulandus calleth the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar,</hi> that ſoveraign medicine and antidote againſt all poyſons.</p>

Scander</hi> a noble man who belonged to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that being troubled with a very grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe at the ſeventy fifth year of his age, was cured by the onely uſe of <hi>Bezoar</hi> taken in the quantitie of five grains in a ſpoonfull of wine. The ſame Authour ſaith, that <hi>D. D.

                     <p>It is ſuppoſed that no other remedy is ſo forcible againſt poyſon as is this.</p>
                     <p>The doſe of it is uſually four grains, more or leſſe either in Carduus water, Baulm water, or Clove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gylo-flower water.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmus Boetius ſaith that the powder contained in the cavity of the ſtone, is of more force then the ſtone it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>It is uſed againſt palpitations of the heart, againſt melancholies, againſt quartan fevers, againſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies, againſt venoms, contagions, and all peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall diſeaſes, and againſt all chronick and diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn diſeaſes.</p>

to be the tears of Deares found in Sicily, when as it is manifeſt that it is found in Pely a Countrey of the Eaſt-Indies.

                     <p>Rulandus maketh mention of ten kinds of this <hi>Marble.</hi> 1. <hi>Marmor candidum Lunenſe,</hi> which he ſaith is the whiteſt and beſt of all the <hi>white Marbles,</hi> and called by the Dutch <hi>ein weiſs Marmorſtein.</hi> 2. <hi>Candidum Cartarienſe.</hi> 3. A <hi>Patavian</hi> or <hi>Paduan white Marble,</hi> called <hi>Marmor Patavium ſerratile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſtone that is made fit for uſe by ſawing. 4. <hi>Italicum Marmor,</hi> or an <hi>Italian Marble,</hi> ſprinkled amidſt its white with many brown and aſhie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured veins. 5. <hi>Marmor candidum Ratisbonenſe,</hi> or <hi>the white Marble of Ratisbone,</hi> of this at Ratisbone they are wont to make <hi>tabulae menſarum</hi> or trenchers withall. Of one of theſe <hi>Marbles</hi> the Altar at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenberg is made; the whole Altar conſiſteth of but one only ſolid <hi>Marble</hi> of this kind; then this <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> there is not a fairer in all Italy. 6. The ſixth kind of <hi>white Marble</hi> is called <hi>Marmor candidiſsimum Carolinum,</hi> becauſe it is found in the Caroline baths. 7. The ſeventh kind of <hi>white Marble</hi> is called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor candidum Hildeſhemium,</hi> from Heildeſhem the place where it is found. This is like in whiteneſſe to ivory. 8. The eighth kind of white <hi>Marble</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Marmor candidum Arabicum;</hi> this likewiſe is as the other found of whiteneſſe like to ivory. 9. The ninth kind is found amongſt mettals at Annenberg,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99609:113"/>
and is therefore called <hi>Marmor candidum Annenber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicum metallicum.</hi> 10. The tenth kind of <hi>white Marble</hi> is called <hi>Hildeſhemium cinereum in candido;</hi> this is of an aſhie colour in a white, and in ſmell it is much like the odour of the burning of horn.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmus Boetius maketh but two kinds of the white <hi>Marble.</hi> Namely, 1. The <hi>lapis Parius,</hi> which is the true <hi>white Marble</hi> and moſt beautifull with an exquiſite hardneſſe. 2. And the <hi>Alaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrites</hi> or <hi>Alabaſtrum</hi> or the common <hi>Alabaſter,</hi> which is of no leſſe beauty then the true <hi>white Marble,</hi> yea if this be well poliſhed it is comparable to the <hi>Onyx</hi> for beauty, and carrieth with it a very lovely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and pleaſing aſpect: the difference betwixt this and the beſt <hi>white Marble</hi> is only this, that the beſt <hi>white Marble</hi> hath an <hi>exquiſita durities</hi> joyned with its beauty, and the <hi>Alabaſter</hi> is for the moſt part found ſomewhat ſofter and leſſe concocted; yet doth not the <hi>Alabaſter</hi> continue in this ſoftneſſe, but by tract of time, and length of dayes, it groweth harder and harder till it doth attain to the perfection of the beſt and faireſt <hi>white Marble.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſtones commonly known and found in moſt places, are generated of a more impure matter (for the moſt part) then are the afore-mentioned ſtones. Theſe ſtones which are ſo well known to all men, are diſtinguiſht amongſt themſelves; either in reſpect of their magnitude, as ſome of them are greater, and ſome of them leſſe; or in reſpect of their conſiſtency; or in reſpect of their qualities; or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their uſe. As concerning the magnitude of theſe ſtones, ſome of them are very large, and hewn out of main rocks of the ſame nature with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; of this kind are free-ſtones, grind-ſtones, whet-ſtones: and others of them are very ſmall, and are found in every field, in every high-way, and in every ſtreet, of this ſort are the pebble-ſtones, flints, and pyrites. As concerning the conſiſtencie of theſe ſtones, or the matter of which they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, ſome of them have their originall of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly matter; others of a ſlimie or muddie ſubſtance; which according to the various operations that nature hath upon it, produceth ſtones either of a ſmooth ſuperficies, or full of ſcales, nodoſe and full of knots. As concerning their qualities, ſome of them are liquable or eaſily molten, as ſome kinds of the ſofter flints: others of them have a ſtrong ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as the <hi>Lapis Aldenburgicus:</hi> and ſome of them are eaſily burned, as the <hi>Lime-ſtone.</hi> As concerning

                     <p>Theſe ſtones (according to Boetius) are of three kinds. 1. A rough gravell ſtone, which is generated of the groſſer part of ſand, and is ſo firmly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as that it is not eaſily levigated; the roughneſſe of its groſſe, ſandy ſubſtance, maketh this ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for levigation; but its well-compactedneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it very fit for building.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A gravell ſtone compacted of the ſmalleſt ſand, mixt with interſplendent ſilver ſpangles. But this is ſo ſoft as that it may eaſily be rubbed to pieces with the fingers. This ſtone is found neare <hi>Prague.</hi>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99609:122"/>
gravell ſtones are very heavie and weighty, and for the moſt part they do conſiſt of divers mixtures: for ſome of them are found in their ſubſtance to be mixt with a multitude of ſmall flints, others with ſmall ſhells, and other little bodies.</p>
